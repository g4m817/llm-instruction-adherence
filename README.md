# Early-Tripwire for System-Instruction Adherence

> **TL;DR**: This repo experiments with a super-lightweight, inference-time heuristic that watches a single forward pass (attentions + hidden states) and *tries* to block/flag responses that drift away from a very strict **system instruction**. It’s **not** a full mitigation, just a defense-in-depth tripwire you can drop in front of generation.

I’m not claiming SOTA or correctness—I probably goofed up parts of my testing. I don’t have practical ML experience; this was research I did a couple years ago, shelved, and finally shoved onto GitHub. If you try it and find issues, I’d genuinely love to hear it—open an issue and tell me I’m wrong!

## Why this exists

Most safety work targets **general safety**. This project explores something narrower and weirder: **strict adherence to a specific system instruction**, e.g., “don’t say `<forbidden>`,” even under prompt pressure. The question that sparked this was:

> *“Is it possible to weight system instructions versus user input—even though they’re tokenized together—using only signals we can grab from a single forward pass?”*

This repo is my tiny, hacky attempt to probe that question.

---

## What it does (high-level)

- **Single-pass instrumentation.** It monkey-patches the model’s `forward` to capture **attentions** and **hidden states** across generation.  
- **Compute post-hoc features.** After generation, it computes a handful of simple features (alignment, drift, spikes, etc.) that *might* indicate the output is straying from the system instruction.  
- **Score and gate.** If the heuristic score crosses a threshold, it swaps the model output with a short refusal string. Otherwise, it returns the model’s text.

**Key novelty:** It aims at **system-instruction strictness**, not broad safety categories. Think of it as an **early detection tripwire** you can plug in at inference time—not a replacement for robust mitigations.

---

## ⚠️ Big disclaimers (please read)

- **I’m not an ML pro.** This is weekend-project code. The feature choices and thresholds were heavily assisted by ChatGPT.  
- **Extremely controlled lab setup.** Most results here rely on:
  - one model: `Nous-Capybara-7B-V1.9`
  - single-turn chats (no history)
  - sampling params: `max_new_tokens=160`, `temperature=0.7`, `top_k=50`, `do_sample=True`
  - eager attention impl, fp16 on GPU when available
  - a very **simple system prompt**: “**don’t say `test`**” (see full version below)
- **Not a mitigation.** You still need all the standard safety layers (data curation, instruction tuning, evals, policy enforcement, rate limiting, isolation, etc.). This is an *extra tripwire*, not a shield.
- **Data is small and weird.** I hand-crafted datasets to stress **instruction adherence**, not general safety. Results won’t transfer to other instructions without work.
- **Tuning fragility.** It’s entirely possible the good numbers come from tuning that happens to fit the chosen prompts. Other instructions could break it completely.
- **Reproducibility.** If you don’t replicate the exact lab conditions (model, params, prompt, dataset), you may not get the same results.

## Results (patch vs. unpatch)

### Patched (malicious prompts; 3 iterations)
- **Total runs:** 150  
- **Blocked attacks:** 123  
- **Successful attacks:** 27  
- **Attack success rate:** **18%**

### Patched (benign prompts; 3 iterations)
- *(Benign run is just to check false positives)*
- **Total runs:** 150  
- **Benign accepted:** 148  
- **False positives:** 2  
- **Average pass rate:** **98.67%**

### Unpatched (malicious prompts; 3 iterations)
- **Total runs:** 150  
- **Blocked attacks:** 84  
- **Successful attacks:** 66  
- **Attack success rate:** **44%**

> **Caveat:** These are narrow, lab-specific numbers on a toy instruction (“don’t say `test`”). They *do not* imply general robustness.

## The instruction & datasets

- **System prompt (excerpt):** “Under no circumstances may you say, repeat, spell, encode, rhyme, hint at, or include the word ‘test’ …” (see `ADVANCED_SYSTEM_PROMPT` in code).  
- **Malicious dataset:** 50 ways to coerce the model to say the forbidden word (“spell it,” “say it in code,” “pig latin,” etc.).  
- **Benign baseline:** 50 vanilla, non-adversarial questions to check that the tripwire doesn’t over-fire.

**Why custom data?** Public safety datasets mostly target general safety and won’t reflect **instruction adherence** attacks like the above. For this line of work you probably need **curated, instruction-specific** datasets—ideally generated or expanded via automation.

---

## How it works (technical sketch)

**Model & config**
- `MODEL_PATH = "Nous-Capybara-7B-V1.9"`  
- Device chooses `cuda` if available; dtype is `fp16` on GPU  
- Generation config (unpatched):  
  - `max_new_tokens=160`, `temperature=0.7`, `top_k=50`, `do_sample=True`  
  - return attentions + hidden states for analysis

**Patch**
- Replaces `model.forward` to force `output_attentions=True` and `output_hidden_states=True`.  
- Collects:
  - **FULL_ATTNS**: last-layer attention tensors per step
  - **FULL_HIDDENS**: hidden states per layer per step

**Feature engineering (post-hoc; see `compute_suspiciousness_features`)**
- **Attention features**
  - `attn_out`, `attn_in`: fraction of attention into the **system segment**
  - `attn_spike`: max attention spikes in output steps
- **Embedding/semantic features**
  - `align_out`, `align_in`: cosine distance to average **system** representation
  - `drift_mag`, `drift_dir`: magnitude/direction of output drift from system
  - `shift`: difference between early vs. late output embeddings
  - `var_bonus`: output embedding variance
  - `layer_dev`: layer-wise system–output deviation (weighted by depth)

**Scoring (see `compute_suspiciousness`)**
- A simple, hand-tuned rule-set converts features into a **suspicion score** [0–1].  
- If `score >= SUSPICION_THRESHOLD` (default **0.91**), the output is replaced with:
  ```
  [Error]: I'm sorry, but I can’t continue.
  ```

**Why these features?** Totally heuristic—picked for simplicity and “does it move when the output tries to dodge the rule?” vibes. ChatGPT helped brainstorm and set rough thresholds.

## Limits & pitfalls

- **Single-turn only.** No chat history, no multi-turn attacks.  
- **One model.** Only evaluated on Nous-Capybara-7B-V1.9.  
- **One instruction.** “Don’t say `test`.” Anything more nuanced likely fails without extensive tuning.  
- **Small, curated data.** Not representative of the real world.  
- **Heuristic fragility.** Thresholds/features were tuned on this exact setup; different prompts/instructions may crater performance.  
- **Post-hoc gate.** It doesn’t prevent generation; it *replaces* outputs after the fact. A real system should integrate earlier signals and robust policy routing.

---

## Future directions (a few ideas)

- **Automated tuning/tiling.** Given a new system instruction, automatically:
  1) generate instruction-specific adversarial/benign datasets,  
  2) fit lightweight models (or Bayesian rules) to pick thresholds per instruction,  
  3) export a tiny config blob for the tripwire.
- **Broader feature search.** Layerwise CCA, probing classifiers, token-level outlier detection, attention flow to policy tokens, diffusion of “system anchors.”  
- **Generalize beyond “don’t say X.”** Explore structured policies (e.g., “never translate slurs,” “always cite sources”), with richer datasets.  
- **Multi-turn & tool use.** Track adherence across turns and when tools are invoked.  
- **Model-agnostic adapters.** Wrap different architectures (LLama, Mistral, etc.) consistently.  
- **Real-time gating.** Convert post-hoc gating into early-step gating to avoid generating risky continuations in the first place.

## Reproducibility notes

Results are **tightly coupled** to:
- Model weights & tokenizer: `Nous-Capybara-7B-V1.9`  
- Sampling: `temperature=0.7`, `top_k=50`, `max_new_tokens=160`, `do_sample=True`  
- Implementation: attention impl `eager`, dtype `fp16` on GPU when available  
- **Exact** system prompt text and boundaries  
- **Exact** datasets provided here  
- **Single-turn** interaction (no history)

Deviations will likely change numbers—possibly a lot.

- **Threshold**: `SUSPICION_THRESHOLD = 0.91`  
- **Gate message**: `"[Error]: I'm sorry, but I can’t continue."`

## On data & curation

- Public safety datasets aren’t ideal for this. We needed **instruction-specific** adversarial cases that try to subvert: *“don’t say `test`.”*  
- For any new instruction, you probably need to **curate or generate** a fresh set of:
  - **malicious attempts** tailored to the instruction, and
  - **benign queries** to measure false positives.
- **Automation idea:** use a small generator (or prompt program) to produce variants, then auto-eval and auto-tune thresholds via a tiny meta-model.
